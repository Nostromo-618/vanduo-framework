# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in Vanduo Framework.

## Current Status

The framework is in an early stage and we are not yet accepting external contributions. This helps us move quickly while the architecture and roadmap are still settling.

We genuinely appreciate your enthusiasm. Please check back later as we plan to open contributions once the project stabilizes.

## How You Can Help Right Now

Even though code contributions are paused, you can still support the project by:

- Reporting bugs or documentation issues via GitHub Issues
- Suggesting ideas or feature requests with clear use cases
- Sharing the project with others who might find it useful

## Future Contributions

When contributions open up, we plan to accept:

- Documentation improvements
- Bug fixes
- New components or enhancements

We will update this file with full guidelines, coding standards, and workflow details at that time.

## Communication

Please use GitHub Issues for questions, bug reports, or feedback. If your report is security-related, follow the instructions in SECURITY.md.
